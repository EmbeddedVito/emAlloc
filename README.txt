Description:
This module allows to use a static allocated buffer to make dynamic allocation of memory. It uses a first fit algorithm.
In addition, it is possibile to define the functions to be used for the locking mechanism in the emAllocPort.h file.
In the amAlloc.h file it is possibile to configure whether or not to use a user-defined memory buffer and the size of the memory buffer to be used.
